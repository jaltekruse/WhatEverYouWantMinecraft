WhatEverYouWantMinecraft
========================
JDK for java 7 required.

Building the project invovles a rather annoying process of downloading and running a decompilation script 
to generate the source for the forge API. If you want to do this, you just need to replace the /mcp/src/minecraft folder
of the resulting file structure to the root of our repo. It can only be launched through an eclipse instance.

complete instructions here:

forge can be downloaded here: we are using 1.6.4 recommended
http://files.minecraftforge.net/

We would be happy to schedule time to run it on one of our machines that already has it set up to save you the trouble.
We would obviously do a pull from the repo of the tagged commit when demonstrating our work so far.
